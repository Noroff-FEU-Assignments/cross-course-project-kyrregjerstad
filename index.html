    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      To secure my clients' website I would advise them to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Requiring a strong password from the user with a minimum of 8
        characters, upper and lower case letters, at least one number and a
        special character. The option of two-factor authentication is also
        greatly increasing security since any malicious user would need access
        to a local device. SMS is not recommended for this since cell provider
        spoofing is a real possibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement an automatic user timeout (or implement the API for it as a
        front-end developer) to automatically time out a user's session after a
        period of inactivity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Never trust a user entry and make sure that any user inputs only accept
        text and not HTML (for example innerText instead of innerHTML)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sanitising all data packages to avoid SQL injection and other malicious
        code intrusion attempts.
      </li>
      <li>
        User a vulnerability testing tool such as
        <a
          href="https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner"
          >Pentest Tools Website Scanner</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>Configuring the webserver to use HTTPS and HSTS.</li>
      <li>
        Only storing and displaying the information that you actually need. If
        the site is storing sensitive information such as credit card info, only
        display the last 4 digits.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
